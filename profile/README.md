ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
Contember is an open source platform for frontend developers to easily build and run custom backends.

Describe your backend in declarative low-code and instantly see how it works in real life.

## Quick overview

- Contember gives you the GraphQL API right from your schema definition. It doesn't force arbitrary collections or posts, you're in control. And in the background, well-structured PostgreSQL is running.
- Your user interface does not depend on your data structure. With [Contember Interface](https://github.com/contember/interface), you can build any UI you want with high-level React components and automatically connect to GraphQL provided by the [Contember Engine](https://github.com/contember/engine). And you can use your own React.js components wherever you want.
- Contember has built-in authentication and powerful role-based access control, handles database migrations, is multilingual and translatable, and much more.

## Create a new project with Contember

To create a new project, just run `npm exec "@contember/create@latest" projectname` and go to the [Quick Start](https://docs.contember.com/intro/quickstart) to learn the basics. It will only take a few minutes.

## Running Contember

We've built and run a managed hosting for Contember. It runs on AWS and already handles dozens of requests every second. It's the easiest way to run Contember. [How to work with Contember Cloud](https://docs.contember.com/guides/deploy-contember).

If you're good at running your own stuff and want to host Contember yourself, here's a [guide to self-hosted Contember](https://docs.contember.com/guides/self-hosted-contember).
